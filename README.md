# Archetypes for Redrock

Archetypes for [redrock](https://github.com/desihub/redrock): the main redshift fitter for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. These are based on physically motivated theoretical spectra of galaxie, quasars and stars generated with [desihub/desisim](https://github.com/desihub/desisim).

These archetypes are designed for use with redrockâ€™s `--archetypes` option.  
- To generate the galaxy archetypes, use `create_galaxy_archetypes.py`.  
- For QSOs and stars, use the scripts stored in the `bin` directory.  

## Installation

This repository contains large files tracked with **Git LFS**.  
Depending on whether you have LFS installed, please follow the appropriate instructions:

### If you have Git LFS installed
```bash

# Just clone the repo as usual
git clone https://github.com/abhi0395/new-archetypes.git
cd new-archetypes
```

### If you do not have Git LFS
Cloning without LFS will only fetch placeholder files for large objects (not the actual data).  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhi0395/new-archetypes.git
cd new-archetypes
```

If later you install `git-lfs`, you can fetch the large files by running:
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

## Usage with Redrock

Once cloned, you can run redrock with the archetypes by pointing to the desired file(s):

```bash
rrdesi_mpi --archetypes path/to/archetype-file.fits ...
```

For more details, see the [redrock documentation](https://github.com/desihub/redrock).
